# MP4 from clicky

A silly open-source extensionlet that sends your video trough an ad-free YouTube downloader when clicked. <br/>
There are only 20ish lines of code. <br/>

This addon is very simple, all it does is open up [9xbuddy](https://9xbuddy.in) when you click the extension while you're watching a YouTube video. Surprisingly, i could not find anything like this that was open-source so i made something myself. <br/>

I might make this addon do downloading client-side sometime, no promises.

`PS`: I have no affiliation with [9xbuddy.](https://9xbuddy.in) I haven't encountered any ads with their site so it's why I'm using it. <br/>
If you do encounter any ads I'd recommend using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin), also feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/FlooferLand/mp4-from-clicky/issues/new) and recommend other sites.
