# MP4 from clicky

Aa silly open-source extensionlet that sends your video trough an ad-free YouTube downloader when clicked. <br/>
There are only 20ish lines of code, and you can view them [here.](https://github.com/FlooferLand mp4-from-clicky) <br/>

This addon is very simple, all it does is open up `9xbuddy` when you click the extension while you're watching a YouTube video. Surprisingly, i could not find anything like this that was open-source so i made something myself. <br/>

I might make this addon do downloading client-side sometime, no promises.

`PS`: I have no affiliation with `9xbuddy`, I haven't encountered any ads with their site so it's why I'm using it. If you do encounter any ads I'd recommend using uBlock Origin, also feel free to open up an issue on Github and recommend other sites.
